# Breakdance Freeze/Pose Classifer

This space classifies breakdance (more accurately, bboying or breaking) freezes based on the input photo.

The model currently recognises two static 3 static freezes: 
- airchair
- airbaby, and
- hollowback

The model also recognises snapshots of two dynamic movements:
- the airflare, and
- headspin

Note: Results may vary depending on the dancerâ€™s form and if there are variations in leg placement (in the context of dance, variations are inevitable in pursuit of creativity or as the result of difference in flexibility).
